# WordleBot

This bot was made to output possible answers for the game Wordle. 

To use:
After running the program, enter your first word, and after seeing the green, yellow, or grey letters in your guess, input numbers for each letter in order. (2 for green, 1 for yellow, and 0 for grey).

The program should output a list of possible answers, choose one of them and repeat to find the correct answer. 

This program was made for fun***
